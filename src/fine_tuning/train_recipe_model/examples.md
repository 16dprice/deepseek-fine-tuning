The duration of a process used to manufacture components is known to be normally distributed with a mean of 30 minutes and a standard deviation of 4 minutes. What is the probability of a time greater than 33 minutes being recorded?

## response

<think> Okay, so I have this problem here about the duration of a manufacturing process. It says the time is normally distributed with a mean of 30 minutes and a standard deviation of 4 minutes. I need to find the probability that the time is greater than 33 minutes. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. First, I remember that in a normal distribution, the probability of a value being greater than the mean is 0.5 because the distribution is symmetric. But here, we're dealing with a specific value, 33 minutes, which is higher than the mean of 30 minutes. So, I need to figure out how far 33 is from the mean in terms of standard deviations and then use that to find the probability. I think the first step is to convert the given time into a z-score. The z-score tells us how many standard deviations away from the mean our value is. The formula for the z-score is: \[ z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma} \] Where: - \( X \) is the value we're interested in (33 minutes), - \( \mu \) is the mean (30 minutes), - \( \sigma \) is the standard deviation (4 minutes). Plugging in the numbers: \[ z = \frac{33 - 30}{4} = \frac{3}{4} = 0.75 \] So, the z-score is 0.75. That means 33 minutes is 0.75 standard deviations above the mean. Now, I need to find the probability that a randomly selected time from this distribution is greater than 33 minutes. In terms of the z-score, this is the probability that Z is greater than 0.75. I recall that the standard normal distribution table (z-table) gives the probability that Z is less than a given value. So, if I look up z = 0.75 in the table, it will give me the probability that Z is less than 0.75, which is the area to the left of the z-score. But I need the area to the right of the z-score, which is the probability that Z is greater than 0.75. To find this, I can subtract the value from the z-table from 1. So, first, let me find the value for z = 0.75. Looking at the z-table, the row for 0.7 and the column for 0.05 (since 0.75 is 0.7 + 0.05). The value there is 0.7734. So, the probability that Z is less than 0.75 is 0.7734. Therefore, the probability that Z is greater than 0.75 is: \[ 1 - 0.7734 = 0.2266 \] So, the probability is 0.2266, which is 22.66%. Wait, let me double-check that. I might have made a mistake in reading the z-table. Sometimes the tables are organized differently, with some having more decimal places or different structures. Let me confirm. Yes, for z = 0.75, the cumulative probability is indeed approximately 0.7734. So subtracting that from 1 gives 0.2266. That seems right. Alternatively, I can use a calculator or a more precise method to find the exact value. But since the z-table gives us 0.7734, which is precise to four decimal places, 0.2266 should be accurate enough. So, putting it all together, the probability that the manufacturing time is greater than 33 minutes is approximately 22.66%. Wait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the z-score calculation. Let me recalculate that: 33 - 30 = 3. 3 divided by 4 is 0.75. Yep, that's correct. So, z = 0.75 is accurate. Another way to think about it is that 33 is three-quarters of a standard deviation above the mean. Since the standard normal distribution is symmetric, the area to the right should be less than 0.5, which 0.2266 is. So, that makes sense. I think I'm confident with this result. So, the probability is approximately 22.66%, which can be expressed as 0.2266 or 22.66%. **Final Answer** The probability of a time greater than 33 minutes being recorded is \boxed{0.2266}. </think> The duration of a manufacturing process is normally distributed with a mean of 30 minutes and a standard deviation of 4 minutes. To find the probability of a time greater than 33 minutes being recorded, we first convert 33 minutes into a z-score using the formula: \[ z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma} \] where \( X = 33 \), \( \mu = 30 \), and \( \sigma = 4 \). Plugging in the values, we get: \[ z = \frac{33 - 30}{4} = \frac{3}{4} = 0.75 \] Next, we use the standard normal distribution table (z-table) to find the probability that \( Z \) is less than 0.75. The z-table gives us a value of 0.7734 for \( z = 0.75 \). This value represents the probability that \( Z \) is less than 0.75. To find the probability that \( Z \) is greater than 0.75, we subtract this value from 1: \[ 1 - 0.7734 = 0.2266 \] Thus, the probability of a time greater than 33 minutes being recorded is \boxed{0.2266}.
